## Uncovering Genetic Resistance to DNA Viruses in *Brassica* Species

#### Hales, A. K., Lazarte, L., Laney, A., Liang, Y . Y .


### Introduction

197 Accessions were requested from the USDA germplasm system to be screened for virus disease resistance. The distribution of these species can be seen below.
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Plots/p4_count.png")
```


The country of origin for these accessions can be seen below. 
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Plots/p2_Country.png")
```

### Results
DSR Progression

```

### Discussion
We fitted a lmer model to explain this data given the important variables being tested Origin and Species.


Let's see how origin and species affected the DSR. Note Stars indicate statistical significance

Now here is Species
